# ✊✋✌️ Stone Paper Scissors — A Simple JavaScript Project
This is a basic Stone Paper Scissors game I built to get more comfortable with JavaScript. It was a fun way to practice conditional logic, randomization, and simple UI interaction.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Using `Math.random()` for generating computer moves
- Writing conditional logic to decide outcomes
- Handling button clicks with event listeners
- Updating the UI dynamically using the DOM

## 🕹️ How to Play
1. Choose between Stone, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The computer picks a random choice.
3. The result (Win/Lose/Draw) is displayed on the screen.

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
